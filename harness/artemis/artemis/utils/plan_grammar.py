"""Single source of truth for the task-plan grammar (the "machine channel").

``task_plan.md`` is a dual-channel document:

- **Machine channel**: the checkbox micro-grammar parsed here (status chars,
  indentation, ``[Loop]`` / ``[Loop:continuous]`` tags). Harness code may only
  ever read this channel.
- **Semantic channel**: all remaining free text. Only LLM agents interpret it;
  harness code must never branch on wording.

Every deterministic decision the harness makes about the plan (termination,
loop protection, validation/checker triggers, hand-slip detection) derives
from the :class:`PlanSnapshot` produced by :func:`parse_plan`. The same
constants render :data:`PLAN_GRAMMAR_SPEC`, the grammar description injected
into agent prompts via the ``{{ plan_grammar }}`` template variable — so the
contract the agents are taught and the contract the code enforces cannot
drift apart.
