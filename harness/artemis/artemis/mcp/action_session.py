"""In-process MCP session over the unified action server.

The in-memory transport (``create_connected_server_and_client_session``) wraps the
server in an ``anyio`` task group whose cancel scope must be entered and exited **in
the same task**. ``ActionSession`` therefore runs the whole context manager inside one
owner task and communicates through events: ``call()`` and ``aclose()`` are safe from
any task, which is what lets the session be created lazily inside an agent node and
torn down from ``ArtemisContext.__aexit__``.

Transport operations additionally run **only in the owner task**, via a request
queue: callers enqueue ``(future, name, args, timeout)`` and await the future. A
caller that times out or is cancelled only abandons its future -- the underlying
``call_tool`` is never cancelled mid-flight. This matters because cancelling
``call_tool`` on the in-memory transport corrupts the shared memory streams and
bricks the session for every subsequent caller (observed live: one 1-second
``asyncio.wait_for`` around a slow hierarchy fetch killed a 24-minute run, with
every later call failing on an empty-message ``BrokenResourceError``).

MCP's native ``read_timeout_seconds`` is just as fatal here (also observed live):
mcp 1.29's ``_handle_response`` delivers a LATE response into the timed-out
request's already-closed response stream, which crashes the client receive loop.
Per-call timeouts therefore travel as a ``timeout_ms`` tool argument and fire
inside the server tool, around the actuator call only -- a timed-out operation
produces a normal error payload and never a late response.

If the transport does die despite all this, the owner loop exits, which flips
``started`` to False so the next ``get_action_session`` builds a fresh session
instead of leaving the rest of the run to fail on a corpse.

The single owner loop also serializes calls, which enforces ARTEMIS's
single-device policy at the one choke point all agents share -- in particular it
stops nested device flows (e.g. Validator and a sub-agent) from interleaving two device
actions.
