"""Session message ledger shared by the Pro operator and Flash runner.

Messages are organized into four regions:

- **S (stable prefix)**: the static system message — byte-identical for the
  whole session (the plan+history section is moved out by the template split).
- **F (frozen history)**: restored history and compressed chunks.
- **A (active window)**: raw per-turn messages, append-only. Each committed
  turn contributes its tail observation HumanMessage, the operator AIMessages
  (tool_calls and native thinking preserved by reference), the in-turn
  ToolMessages, and the turn's result message (every turn on the Pro path;
  only when an action failed on the Flash path). The
  scrub edge (:class:`~artemis.agents.flash.context_compressor.ScrubEdgeCompressor`)
  has two depths: a shallow text edge (UI list, plan recitation and ephemeral
  per-turn blocks leave as soon as a newer observation exists) and a
  screenshot edge that follows the occupancy tier (relaxed below the start
  gate, tightened past it), where the screenshot is replaced in place by its
  visual summary. Every rewrite happens once and is never undone; everything
  newer is byte-identical to what the model was first shown. Messages are
  never removed or reordered, so tool-call/response pairs are never split.
- **T (current tail)**: built fresh every turn by the operator; passed to
  :meth:`render` and only enters A when the turn is committed.

All timestamps inside the transcript use the session-start offset ``T+mm:ss``
(byte-stable once frozen); "ago" wording is reserved for the auxiliary agents'
per-call compiled views. When the caller supplies the DataEngine
``session_start`` epoch, the ledger clock is anchored to it so the tail
offsets, the chunk ledger lines and the video analyzer's action timeline all
share one origin.

Profiles: the Pro operator (one committed turn per graph step) and the Flash
runner (one committed turn per reactive turn; a multi-action turn registers
every recorded step id via ``extra_step_keys`` so the chunk ledger lists each
step) build their prompts from the same ledger.

        **differentially**: the ledger remembers the previous measured
        sample ``(text_chars, image_count, prompt_tokens)`` and, when the new
        sample carries the same number of images, grows the text by at least
        :data:`MIN_CALIBRATION_DELTA_CHARS` and costs more tokens, it pools
        the pair's differences (``pooled_chars += Δchars``,
        ``pooled_tokens += Δtokens``) and sets the ratio to
        ``pooled_chars / pooled_tokens``, clamped to [1.0, 6.0]. The pooled
        quotient is the maximum-likelihood single ratio for the session (no
        smoothing constant to tune, no last-pair noise). The reference is
        replaced only when it was consumed, when the image count changed, or
        when the prompt shrank in tokens (a compaction or scrub reset the
        baseline); a sample that moved too little keeps the reference, so
        several small turns accumulate into one usable difference instead of
        being discarded one by one (real sessions often grow < 2000 chars
        per turn and would otherwise never calibrate).

        Why differences: the provider's ``prompt_tokens`` also counts terms
        that are not in ``messages`` or not proportional to their text — the
        bound tool/function schemas, and full-size screenshots that tile to
        ~1100–1800 tokens rather than the flat :data:`IMAGE_BLOCK_TOKENS`.
        A whole-prompt quotient charges all of that to the text, and it
        also averages over the static prefix, whereas the chunker applies
        the ratio to the transcript *tail*, whose density differs. On real
        Gemini Operator traces (10 sessions, 2026-09) the two disagree by
        5-30% with a session-dependent sign, so the size-based chunk
        trigger fired early in some sessions and late in others. Between
        two prompts with the same image count the constant terms cancel and
        the difference measures the tail's own rate. Until the first
        usable difference exists the whole-prompt quotient
        ``text_chars / (prompt_tokens - images * IMAGE_BLOCK_TOKENS)`` is
        used as a fallback; once a pooled difference exists the pooled ratio
        is authoritative and the fallback is no longer applied.
