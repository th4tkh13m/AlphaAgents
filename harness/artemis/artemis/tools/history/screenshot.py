"""get_step_screenshot: one recorded screenshot of one step, on demand.

``pre`` is the screen observed at the start of the step, ``post`` the screen
after its action (when recorded), ``overlay`` the pre screenshot with the
step's action drawn on it (tap point / swipe path) so a reviewer can check
that the action landed on the intended element. The overlay is drawn from the
step's *raw* stored action (physical pixels), never from the normalized twin.
