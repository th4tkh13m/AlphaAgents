"""Per-node State visibility manifests with test-time enforcement.

``extra="forbid"`` on :class:`~artemis.graph.state.State` catches ghost
*writes*; ghost *reads* (``getattr(state, key, default)`` silently returning
the default) can only be caught by policing reads against a declared manifest.

The manifest below is the declared visible domain of every graph node — the
authoritative answer to "which State fields does this agent see / produce".
Enforcement is zero-cost in production: :func:`strict_state` returns the state
unchanged unless ``ARTEMIS_STRICT_STATE=1`` (set in tests), in which case field
reads outside the node's manifest raise :class:`VisibilityError`.
