"""End-to-end device observation smoke test.

The readiness ADB probe only proves that ``adb devices`` and ``dumpsys`` answer.
The most common "device shows Connected but ARTEMIS cannot observe it" failure
is UIAutomator not answering (screenshot / hierarchy dump hangs), which today
only surfaces as a failed task. :func:`smoke_test_device` performs exactly the
observation the ``mobile_get_device_state`` MCP tool performs -- build (or reuse)
the cached device controller through ``artemis.mcp.adb_server._get_controller``
and call ``controller.get_screen_data()`` -- and reports a structured verdict
with concrete repair guidance instead of raising.

Design notes
------------
* ``_get_controller`` is synchronous, caches one controller per serial for the
  life of the process and never touches ``DeviceExecutionLock``. Its first call
  for a serial blocks on ``UIAutomatorClient.get_screen_data()`` (three
  ``u2.connect`` attempts plus a screenshot and hierarchy dump), so it runs on a
  worker thread here.
* ``AdbDriver.get_screen_data`` invokes the synchronous UIAutomator client on
  the event-loop thread. A plain ``asyncio.wait_for`` around the coroutine can
  therefore never fire while UIAutomator hangs. The coroutine is executed on a
  dedicated daemon thread with its own event loop, and the deadline is enforced
  on the join. A thread abandoned by a timeout finishes on its own once the
  underlying adb / HTTP timeouts elapse; being a daemon it never delays
  interpreter shutdown.
* ``u2.connect`` restarts the on-device UIAutomator server when it believes the
  server is unhealthy. Running that against a device another ARTEMIS process is
  driving would break the running task's session, so a device with a live
  ``DeviceExecutionLock`` owner is reported as busy instead of probed.
* Nothing is left behind: no screenshot is written to disk, no lock is taken,
  and -- mirroring ``mobile_get_device_state`` -- the cached controller is kept
  for reuse rather than closed.
